Applicants may suggest a different project size as part of their application - this should be negotiated with them during the application period.

        **(Optional) We highly encourage you to add a means to assess a potential contributor's skills prior to the start of the contributor application period in Feb - March.

        This helps applicants gauge their abilities against your expectations as a mentor and provides a means for you to evaluate their skills and coding abilities separate from the written GSoC proposal.  
        
        Google, and IOOS, both strongly discourage mentors from assessing applicants based solely on their GSoC project propsals alone.  
        
        Communication with applicants during the application period is highly recommended and filling in this information will help to get that started.  Expect interested applicants to follow any links you provide during the application period and be prepared to field PRs as well as GitHub issue comments/questions about what is included here.
