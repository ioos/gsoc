# Student Contributing Guide

## Getting Started

The best thing to help your application is to contact the organization and mentors you want to work with early.  You can introduce yourself in an issue with, or perhaps send a small PR to the project.

[The opensource guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) has a good introduction how to start contributing to open source projects.

## Do I have the experience to apply?

The answer is generally: **Yes**.
Note that our organization values creativity, intelligence and enthusiasm above specific knowledge of the libraries or algorithms we use.
We think that a motivated students who are willing to learn are more valuable than anything else.

The [GSoC Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/am-i-good-enough#) gives a good overview of this part for GSoC.

## What We Expect From Students

### During the application phase

We usually favor students that show regular communication with mentors during the application period and are able to demonstrate a clear understanding of the challenge proposed in the project idea within their application.  In some cases, mentors may include existing GitHub issues or other references within their code that students can use to both understand the software and, in some cases, demonstrate they have a good chance to succeed in addressing the problem presented in the project idea.  

*These tips are here to help with your application. They are not required.*

- Have you communicated with the organization's mentors during the application period?
- Have you communicated with the community?
- Did you reference projects you coded WITH links to repos or provided code?
- Did you provide methods for mentors to contact you?
- Did you state which project you are applying for and why you believe you will be successful in completing the project?
- Did you share your proposed project plan with mentor(s) prior to the close of the application period to give them the opportunity to give feedback or ask you questions?
- Does your project plan clearly state the steps you will take during GSoC to address the goals or challenges in the proposed project? 
- Did you create a pull request on the existing code?
- Did you continue communication until accepted students are announced?
- Do you have time for GSoC? This is a paid job! State that you have time in your motivation letter, and list other commitments!
- Does you application describe what motivates you to work on this project, and, how your involvement in GSoC and this project in particular furthers your career goals?
