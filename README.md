### **Announcement: GSoC 2025 Project Ideas Needed!**

IOOS is looking for new project ideas for [GSoC 2025](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com)!  GSoC Organization applications are due **February 11, 2025** - we need a strong list of projects and mentors by this deadline to reapply for 2025.  

If you are interested in mentoring a student during this year's GSoC program, please submit your project idea below:

[**2025 Mentors: submit your project idea here**](https://github.com/ioos/gsoc/issues/new?template=gsoc-project-proposal.yml)

Questions about the GSoC mentoring experience can go to any of IOOS' former GSoC mentors - see [IOOS and Google Summer of Code](#ioos-and-google-summer-of-code) for all of our former projects, students and mentors, or post to the ['ioos_tech'](https://groups.google.com/g/ioos_tech) mailing list.


#### **Update:** Materials for IOOS' 2025 GSoC Organization Application

### U.S. IOOS&reg; - Eyes on the Ocean, Coasts, and Great Lakes&trade;

#### Our Mission
To produce, integrate, and communicate high quality ocean, coastal and Great Lakes information that meets the safety, economic, and stewardship needs of the Nation.

The U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS®) is a national-regional partnership working to provide new tools and forecasts to improve safety, enhance the economy, and protect our environment. Integrated ocean information is available in near real time, as well as retrospectively. Easier and better access to this information is improving our ability to understand and predict coastal events - such as storms, wave heights, and sea level change. Such knowledge is needed for everything from retail to development planning.

For more information about IOOS visit: [https://ioos.noaa.gov](https://ioos.noaa.gov).

#### Our Community

The [IOOS Data Management and Cyberinfrastructure](https://ioos.noaa.gov/project/dmac/) (DMAC) community is a diverse and inclusive group of scientific software developers focused on developing and supporting open source software to deliver oceanographic and other earth science data to users worldwide.

#### Community Events

IOOS hosts annual DMAC [data management meetings](https://ioos.noaa.gov/project/dmac/), bi-annual code sprints ([2019](https://www.glos.us/code-sprint/), [2022](https://ioos.github.io/ioos-code-sprint/2022/), [2024](https://ioos.github.io/ioos-code-sprint/2024/)), monthly technical webinars, and maintains virtual communications through our ['ioos_tech'](https://groups.google.com/g/ioos_tech) mailing list and other platforms such as [GitHub](https://github.com/ioos) and Slack.


### IOOS and Google Summer of Code

IOOS has previously participated as a GSoC mentoring organization, with many successfully completed student projects.  See the links below for more information.

#### Guidance for Potential IOOS GSoC Mentors

In Google's Summer of Code Guides there is a great article about [What Makes a Good Mentor?](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/what-makes-a-good-mentor.html). If you are considering being a mentor for the IOOS ogranization, we highly recommend reviewing the materials there. This will ensure you are prepared for what is to come over the summer and can assist you in deciding on a contributor.

*Some tips from IOOS for how to write a good GSoC project idea*

The most successful GSoC project ideas involve ***previously-existing, open source software packages*** that might benefit from the addition of a new feature, capability or related application or tool, resolving a thorny bug that you don’t quite have time to address yourself as a package maintainer, or the addition of use-case examples that involve developing and publishing new code (e.g. Jupyter notebook usage demonstrations).  

GSoC is not for getting assistance from a student (aka ‘contributor’) with writing documentation or for starting new projects without pre-existing open source code.  The program is designed to teach contributors about your software and project maintainer community (even if only yourself), how to write better code, and to learn about the process of open source software development itself.

**Draft or initial project ideas are OK.**  Project ideas need to include basic background information (project description and purpose, expected skills, mentor names), but it’s a fairly easy lift to propose a new project.  If IOOS is accepted for the 2025 program, project ideas can be further refined or improved over the next month until the contributor application period begins in March.
