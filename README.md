### U.S. IOOS&reg; - Eyes on the Ocean, Coasts, and Great Lakes&trade;

#### Our Mission
To produce, integrate, and communicate high quality ocean, coastal and Great Lakes information that meets the safety, economic, and stewardship needs of the Nation.

The U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOSÂ®) is a national-regional partnership working to provide new tools and forecasts to improve safety, enhance the economy, and protect our environment. Integrated ocean information is available in near real time, as well as retrospectively. Easier and better access to this information is improving our ability to understand and predict coastal events - such as storms, wave heights, and sea level change. Such knowledge is needed for everything from retail to development planning.

The [IOOS Data Management and Cyberinfrastructure](https://ioos.noaa.gov/project/dmac/) (DMAC) community is a coalition of scientific software developers focused on developing and supporting software used within our own community and also by other scientific organizations to deliver earth science data to their users.  IOOS maintains several open source packages for oceanographic data management that are used by ocean observing organizations worldwide.

We host annual DMAC [data management meetings](https://ioos.noaa.gov/project/dmac/), code sprints ([2019](https://www.glos.us/code-sprint/), [2022](https://ioos.github.io/ioos-code-sprint/)), monthly technical webinars, and maintain virtual communications through our ['ioos_tech'](https://groups.google.com/g/ioos_tech) mailing list and other platforms such as Slack and GitHub.
