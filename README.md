IOOS is looking for new project ideas for [GSoC 2024](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024)!  GSoC Organization applications are due **February 6, 2024** - we need a strong list of projects and mentors by this deadline to reapply for 2024.  

If you are interested in mentoring a student during this year's GSoC program, please submit your project idea below:

[**2024 Mentors: submit your project idea here**](https://github.com/ioos/gsoc/issues/new/choose)

Questions about the GSoC mentoring experience can go to any of IOOS' former GSoC mentors - see [Past IOOS GSoC Projects](#Past-IOOS-GSoC-Projects) for all of our former projects, students and mentors, or posted to the ['ioos_tech'](https://groups.google.com/g/ioos_tech) mailing list.

### U.S. IOOS&reg; - Eyes on the Ocean, Coasts, and Great Lakes&trade;

#### Our Mission
To produce, integrate, and communicate high quality ocean, coastal and Great Lakes information that meets the safety, economic, and stewardship needs of the Nation.

The U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOSÂ®) is a national-regional partnership working to provide new tools and forecasts to improve safety, enhance the economy, and protect our environment. Integrated ocean information is available in near real time, as well as retrospectively. Easier and better access to this information is improving our ability to understand and predict coastal events - such as storms, wave heights, and sea level change. Such knowledge is needed for everything from retail to development planning.

For more information about IOOS visit: [https://ioos.noaa.gov](https://ioos.noaa.gov).

#### Our Community

The [IOOS Data Management and Cyberinfrastructure](https://ioos.noaa.gov/project/dmac/) (DMAC) community is a diverse and inclusive group of scientific software developers focused on developing and supporting open source software to deliver oceanographic and other earth science data to users worldwide.

#### Community Events

IOOS hosts annual DMAC [data management meetings](https://ioos.noaa.gov/project/dmac/), code sprints ([2019](https://www.glos.us/code-sprint/), [2022](https://ioos.github.io/ioos-code-sprint/2022/)), monthly technical webinars, and maintains virtual communications through our ['ioos_tech'](https://groups.google.com/g/ioos_tech) mailing list and other platforms such as Slack and GitHub.

**2024 IOOS Code Sprint - Washington, DC:** IOOS will be hosting a hybrid in-person/virtual [Code Sprint in Washington, DC (May 21 - 23, 2024)](https://ioos.github.io/ioos-code-sprint/2024/), providing a great opportunity for mentors and GSoC students to either have some face time to work together in person, if feasible, or virtually on kick-starting their projects during the community bonding period.  Some travel grants/reimbursements will be available for eligible participants. Mark your calendars!
