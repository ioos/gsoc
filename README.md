### About U.S. IOOS&reg; - Eyes on the Ocean, Coasts, and Great Lakes&trade;

#### Our Mission
To produce, integrate, and communicate high quality ocean, coastal and Great Lakes information that meets the safety, economic, and stewardship needs of the Nation.

The U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS®) is a national-regional partnership working to provide new tools and forecasts to improve safety, enhance the economy, and protect our environment. Integrated ocean information is available in near real time, as well as retrospectively. Easier and better access to this information is improving our ability to understand and predict coastal events - such as storms, wave heights, and sea level change. Such knowledge is needed for everything from retail to development planning.

For more information about IOOS visit: [https://ioos.noaa.gov](https://ioos.noaa.gov).

#### Our Community

The [IOOS Data Management and Cyberinfrastructure](https://ioos.noaa.gov/project/dmac/) (DMAC) community is a diverse and inclusive group of scientific software developers focused on developing and supporting open source software to deliver oceanographic and other earth science data to users worldwide.

#### Community Events

IOOS hosts annual DMAC [data management meetings](https://ioos.noaa.gov/project/dmac/), bi-annual code sprints ([2019](https://www.glos.us/code-sprint/), [2022](https://ioos.github.io/ioos-code-sprint/2022/), [2024](https://ioos.github.io/ioos-code-sprint/2024/), and upcoming in [2026](https://ioos.github.io/ioos-code-sprint/2026/)), monthly DMAC technical webinars, and maintains virtual communications through our ['ioos_tech'](https://groups.google.com/g/ioos_tech) mailing list and other platforms such as [GitHub](https://github.com/ioos) and Slack.
