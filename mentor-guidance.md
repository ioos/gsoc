# IOOS' GSoC Mentor Guide

## Mentor Overview

Interested in flexing your mentoring skils an mentoring a GSoC contributor this year?  

IOOS needs you - a new or returning mentor from the DMAC community - to submit your project ideas and support our application as a GSoC mentoring organization before the Org application deadline - **in early February** - in order to re-apply to this year's GSoC program. 

Read on for info about: 
* [Proposing a GSoC project to IOOS](#proposing-a-project-to-google-summer-of-code--ioos),
* IOOS' [expectations for GSoC mentors](#what-is-expected-of-mentors),
* the [GSoC timeline](#gsoc-mentor-timeline) from a mentor's perspective,
* tips for [good GSoC project ideas](##what-makes-a-good-gsoc-project), and more.  

__**Submit your project idea:**__ check out the [README](https://github.com/ioos/gsoc) for the latest information on IOOS' application this year and links to submit a project idea. 


## Proposing a project to Google Summer of Code & IOOS

To get an idea for projects that IOOS has sponsored in previous GSoC years, see the project ideas and results list in the [IOOS and Google Summer of Code](https://github.com/ioos/gsoc#ioos-and-google-summer-of-code) section of the README.

_What makes a good GSoC project idea (IOOS' perspective):_

The most successful GSoC project ideas involve ***previously-existing, open source software packages*** that might benefit from the addition of a new feature, capability or related application or tool, resolving a thorny bug that you, and a package maintainer, have the expertise to assist another developer in resolving, or the addition of use-case examples that involve developing and publishing new code (e.g. Jupyter notebook software use case demonstrations). 

**Draft or initial project ideas are OK.**  Project ideas need to include basic background information (project description and purpose, expected skills, mentor names, emails, and GitHub aliases), but it’s a fairly easy lift to propose a new project.  If IOOS is re-accepted this year, project ideas can be further refined or improved over the next month until the contributor application period begins in March. 

_What GSoC is *not* suitable for:_ 

GSoC is not the right program if you're looking to hire a summer intern for 'free' to lessen your to do list!  It is fundamentally about teaching aspiring developers/coders how to write code and contribute in an effective and respectful way to open source software and communities.  Time committment as a mentor to work with your contributor, review code, provide feedback/guidance, and to meet virtually on a routine schedule to review progress and discuss upcoming work/goals is essential.  

GSoC is also not suitable for developing documentation about your code, or to start a new projects without _pre-existing, publicly-available, open source code_.  

The GSoC program is designed to teach contributors about your software and project maintainer community (even if only yourself), how to write better code, and to learn about the process of open source software development itself, including interacting with existing contributors in GitHub or other online forums.  As such, a pre-existing open source code base is required.


## What is Expected of Mentors?
IOOS as a GSoC mentoring organization values creativity, intelligence and enthusiasm above specific knowledge of the libraries or algorithms we use.  

Please [reach out to us](mailto:micah.wengren@noaa.gov,mathew.biddle@noaa.gov,ocefpaf@gmail.com) if you have questions about whether your project/project idea is suitable for inclusion as part of IOOS' application.  

Google has a great article about [What Makes a Good GSoC Mentor?](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/what-makes-a-good-mentor.html) and futher details on GSoC mentoring in general in the full [Mentor Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/). If you are considering submitting a project idea to mentor for IOOS, we highly recommend starting there. 

Reading the mentoring guide will ensure:
* you know how the program works,
* you know the level of committment typically expected of mentors,
* you're aware of Google's advice and guidance for how best to select a contributor for your project,
* you're aware of things to watch out for in evaluating GSoC contributors/applications,
* you know what past mentors and GSoC administrators have found most essential for a successful mentoring experience during the summer coding period.


## GSoC Mentor Timeline

The GSoC timeline, from a mentor's persepective, is as follows:
1. **Mentors** submit project ideas to the IOOS Organization following the guidance here _(Jan - early Feb)_
1. IOOS reviews submitted project ideas, provides feedback to prospective mentors, and creates a 'Project Ideas List' (e.g. [2025's ideas list](https://github.com/ioos/gsoc/blob/main/2025/ideas-list.md)) of this year's potential projects
1. IOOS submits our ideas list to Google as part a GSoC mentoring organization application _(early Feb)_ 
1. Google reviews Org applications and announces accepted mentoring Orgs _(mid Feb)_ 
1. If IOOS is accepted, interested GSoC contributors will begin to engage with **mentors** via the project ideas list and associated project-specific GitHub issues and/or any linked code repositories _(mid-Feb - mid-Mar)_
1. **Mentors** collaborate with potential contributors and evaluate their suitability for the project and to assist them with developing their applications (ideally). See [evaluating contributors](#evaluating-project-contributors)  _(mid-Feb - mid-Mar)_
1. Contributors submit applications via GSoC website for IOOS' projects ideas _(end of Mar)_
1. **Mentors** review applications submitted for their project ideas _(early - mid Apr)_
1. **Mentors** select either the best application for their idea to put forward to IOOS for Org-wide ranking, or select none if no applications are suitable to go forward or show promise for success _(mid Apr)_
1. IOOS ranks all mentor-selected applications and submits a ranked list of projects to Google for sponsorship/'slot' allocation
1. Google announces the number of 'slots', or accepted projects, for IOOS for the year _(end of Apr)_
1. **Mentors** whose projects have been granted a slot begin working with their contributors during the 'Community Bonding Period' _(May)_
1. **Mentors** and contributors work together on their projects during the summer Coding Period (typically runs for three months ending in August) _(Jun - Aug)_ 
1. Contributors submit their code or other products to mentors as agreed upon during the Coding Period
1. Contributors submit a final summary/writeup of their work at completion of their individual project, including links to code contributed (e.g. pull requests, modules, etc)
1. **Mentors** submit mid-term and final evaluations of their contributors' work. These are breakpoints at which a project can be failed. See [Warning Signs](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/warning-signs) for more details on warning signs to look out for in a project.


## What makes a good GSoC project?

An ideal GSoC project idea should consider the following:
1. Follow the [GSoC Project Issue Template](https://github.com/ioos/gsoc/issues/new?template=gsoc-project-proposal.yml)
1. Projects should take ~90 hour, ~175 hours or ~350 hours for GSoC contributors to complete.
1. Don’t be vague about the ideas. Be sure to write a few sentences describing what you need accomplished and not just an overall theoretical version of what you might want.
1. Briefly describe a general high-level need, and the motivation behind that need. Keeping the scope modest helps encourage more applicants, while adding a “stretch” goal to the project description may encourage stronger GSoC contributors to take on the challenge of meeting it.
1. Include a contributor evaluation challenge or test - this will help you to determine if an applicant's technical skills align with your project. 
1. Don’t propose projects that neither you nor anyone else wants to mentor.


## Evaluating project contributors

We usually favor contibutors that show regular communication with mentors during the application period and are able to demonstrate a clear understanding of the challenge proposed in the project idea within their proposal.  

In some cases, mentors may include existing GitHub issues or other references within their code that applicants can use to both understand the software and, in some cases, demonstrate they have a good chance to succeed in addressing the problem presented in the project idea.  

**Mentors:** please review the IOOS GSoC [Contributor Guidance](https://github.com/ioos/gsoc/blob/main/contributor-guidance.md) and [Proposal Template](https://github.com/ioos/gsoc/blob/main/proposal-template.md).  We strongly encourage you to favor applications that follow the IOOS proposal template and include answers to all questions in their application in addition to the criteria below for evaluating contributors - this can help to filter AI-generated proposals

Engage with GSoC contributors as early as possible after accepted Orgs are announced and the contributor application period begins _(mid Feb - Mar)_. They will contact you via GitHub or otherwise if interested in your project idea - take the time to interact with them as much as possible as this is time well-spent in terms of ensuring the greatest likelihood of success in a GSoC mentor/contributor relationship.  Integrate the GSoC contributor into your community and its communication channels. Make sure that communication with your GSoC contributor is frequent and regular.

*These tips are here to help with a mentor's evaluation of a contributor. They are not required.*

- [ ] Does their GitHub user account page have some information about them? Ideally a contributors account page would have an appropriate avatar and a short description about their interests and/or past contributions. Avoid accounts created weeks or days before they start corresponding with mentors as these could be dubious contributors.
- [ ] Have they communicated with you as a potential mentor during the application period?
- [ ] Have they communicated with the community?
- [ ] Did they reference projects you coded with links to repos or provided code?
- [ ] Did they provide methods for mentors to contact them?
- [ ] Did they state which project they are applying for and why they believe they will be successful in completing the project?
- [ ] Did they share their proposed project plan with mentor(s) prior to the close of the application period to give them the opportunity to give feedback or ask questions/provide feedback?
- [ ] Does their project plan clearly state the steps they will take during GSoC to address the goals or challenges in the proposed project? 
- [ ] Did they create a pull request on the existing code?
- [ ] Did they continue communication throughout the application period?
- [ ] Do they have time for GSoC? This is a paid job! Contributors should state that you have time in your motivation letter, and list other commitments!
- [ ] Does their application describe what motivates them to work on this project, and, how their involvement in GSoC and this project in particular furthers their career goals?
- [ ] Did they follow the IOOS GSoC proposal template and guidance in developing their application?  Did they include all sections or address any questions you might have had for them during the application period?
- [ ] Does their application look generic or possibly AI-generated?  Or, have they not interacted with you at all prior to submitting their application?  These are **red flag warning signs** that, from our experience, have indicated caution before deciding to accept a contributor.
