# Mentor Guide

## Getting Started

If IOOS is included as a GSoC mentoring organization for the year (typically announced in late February per the [GSoC program timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline), we invite interested mentors to propose project ideas using our [GSoC Project Issue Template](https://github.com/ioos/gsoc/issues/new?template=gsoc-project-proposal.yml). 

The process for GSoC follows this rough outline:
1. **Mentor** submits a project idea to the IOOS Organization following the guidance here.
1. IOOS reviews the list of project ideas to determine which will proceed.
1. IOOS submits an application to Google with the list of proposed project ideas.
1. Google reviews the organization application and notifies which ogranizations have been accepted and which projects within the organization have been accepted.
1. If accepted, potential GSoC contributors will engage with the project ideas via GitHub issues.
1. **Mentors** collaborate with potential contributors and evaluate their suitability for the project. See [evaluating contributors](#evaluating-project-contributors).
1. Contributors submit applications to IOOS.
1. IOOS ranks applications.
1. Google announces accepted projects.
1. If accepted, coding runs for four months (typically May - August). **Mentors** support the project throughout the coding period.
1. Contributors submit mid-term and final summaries of their work.
1. Mid-term and final evaluations are submitted by the Mentor. These are breakpoints at which a project can be failed. See [Warning Signs](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/warning-signs) for more details on warning signs to look out for in a project.

**Further Background:** 
* [Google Summer of Code Guide - Mentor](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/) has great information about being a GSoC mentor.

### Do I have the experience to be a mentor?

The answer is generally: **Yes**.
Note that our organization values creativity, intelligence and enthusiasm above specific knowledge of the libraries or algorithms we use.

The [GSoC Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/what-makes-a-good-mentor) gives a good overview of what makes a good mentor.

## Proposing a project to Google Summer of Code & IOOS

To get an idea for the previous projects that have been proposed for the IOOS Organization, see the previous year's project ideas and results in the [README](https://github.com/ioos/gsoc#ioos-and-google-summer-of-code).

### What makes a good GSoC project?

An ideal GSoC project idea should consider the following:
1. Follow the [GSoC Project Issue Template](https://github.com/ioos/gsoc/issues/new?template=gsoc-project-proposal.yml)
1. Projects should take ~90 hour, ~175 hours or ~350 hours for GSoC contributors to complete.
1. Don’t be vague about the ideas. Be sure to write a few sentences describing what you need accomplished and not just an overall theoretical version of what you might want.
1. Briefly describe a general high-level need, and the motivation behind that need. Keeping the scope modest helps encourage more applicants, while adding a “stretch” goal to the project description may encourage stronger GSoC contributors to take on the challenge of meeting it.
1. Don’t propose projects that neither you nor anyone else wants to mentor.

### Evaluating project contributors

We usually favor students that show regular communication with mentors during the application period and are able to demonstrate a clear understanding of the challenge proposed in the project idea within their proposal.  
In some cases, mentors may include existing GitHub issues or other references within their code that students can use to both understand the software and, in some cases, demonstrate they have a good chance to succeed in addressing the problem presented in the project idea.  

*These tips are here to help with a mentors evaluation of a contributor. They are not required.*

- Have they communicated with the organization's mentors during the application period?
- Have they communicated with the community?
- Did they reference projects you coded WITH links to repos or provided code?
- Did they provide methods for mentors to contact you?
- Did they state which project you are applying for and why you believe you will be successful in completing the project?
- Did they share your proposed project plan with mentor(s) prior to the close of the application period to give them the opportunity to give feedback or ask you questions?
- Does their project plan clearly state the steps you will take during GSoC to address the goals or challenges in the proposed project? 
- Did they create a pull request on the existing code?
- Did they continue communication until accepted students are announced?
- Do they have time for GSoC? This is a paid job! State that you have time in your motivation letter, and list other commitments!
- Does their application describe what motivates them to work on this project, and, how their involvement in GSoC and this project in particular furthers their career goals?
