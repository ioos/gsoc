# GSoC 2024 Results

U.S. IOOS is participating for the third time as a mentoring organization for Googleâ€™s Summer of Code.
For the 2024 GSoC edition there are four new projects ranging from data visualization, data accessibility, data pre-processing for cloud optimization, and code re-factorization.

The projects were:

- [erddap](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/ioos/projects/details/VRUk5pC9): Enhancements for Erddap administrators.
- [gliderpy](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/ioos/projects/details/8h63Owzq): Data Visualization with Gliderpy.
- [ioos_qc](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/ioos/projects/details/eqZttvrN): QA/QC for glider data.
- [kerchunk](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/ioos/projects/details/nLJFBbIV): Kerchunk enhancements for fast NODD GRIB aggregations.
- [searvey](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/ioos/projects/details/tWUJtS4s): Enhancing Searvey: Real-Time Observational Data Unification, Analysis, and Retrieval.
- [STOFS](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/ioos/projects/details/VxCwfSg0): STOFS Subsetting Tool.


Important highlights:

- The GSoC'24 ERDDAP project was a major improvement to the XML parser which is a core part of defining how datasets are loaded.
- Gliderpy's plotting interface was completely refactored, making it more flexible and much easier to build on.
- `ioos_qc` support for glider QA/QC was added during GSoC edition. The final form is still under work, but this project help start the discussion on how to properly implement them.
